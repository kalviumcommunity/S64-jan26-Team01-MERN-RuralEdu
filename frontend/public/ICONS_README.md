# PWA Icons

This app requires two icon files for PWA functionality:

- `icon-192.png` (192x192 pixels)
- `icon-512.png` (512x512 pixels)

## Quick Setup

You can create these icons using any image editor or online tool:

1. Create a simple logo with the RuralEdu branding (blue color: #18659e)
2. Export as PNG at the required sizes
3. Place both files in the `/public` directory

## Temporary Solution

For development, you can use a simple colored square or the RuralEdu logo.
The app will work without icons, but the install prompt may not appear on all devices.
