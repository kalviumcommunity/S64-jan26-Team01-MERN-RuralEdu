In this concept, you’ll learn how to define and enforce role-based access control (RBAC) in your Next.js app to ensure that users only access what they’re permitted to. You’ll implement role hierarchies, apply permission checks in both API routes and UI components, and document how your app enforces access policies securely and transparently.

Note: These are general guidelines. You may customize your role structure and permission logic based on your team’s API design and feature set.

What You’ll Do
1. Understand the Core Idea of RBAC
RBAC is a security model that assigns permissions to users based on their role rather than individual identity. For example:

Role	Permissions
Admin	Create, Read, Update, Delete (all resources)
Editor	Read, Update (specific resources)
Viewer	Read-only access
Pro Tip: Define broad roles and clear boundaries — too many granular roles can lead to confusion and maintenance overhead.

2. Define Roles and Permissions
Create a role mapping object (either hardcoded or from your database):

// src/config/roles.js
export const roles = {
  admin: ['create', 'read', 'update', 'delete'],
  editor: ['read', 'update'],
  viewer: ['read'],
};
Store each user’s role in their JWT payload or session after authentication:

const payload = { userId, role: 'editor' };
const token = jwt.sign(payload, process.env.JWT_SECRET, { expiresIn: '15m' });
3. Apply Role Checks in API Routes
Protect sensitive API endpoints by verifying the user’s role before performing actions:

import { roles } from '@/config/roles';

export default function handler(req, res) {
  const { role } = req.user;

  if (!roles[role].includes('delete')) {
    return res.status(403).json({ error: 'Access denied: insufficient permissions.' });
  }

  // Proceed with delete operation
  res.status(200).json({ message: 'Resource deleted successfully.' });
}
Ensure middleware verifies the JWT and attaches user data before the handler runs.

Security Tip: Avoid performing permission checks only on the frontend — always enforce them in backend/API routes as well.

4. Control Access in the UI
Conditionally render UI elements based on role permissions:

const userRole = session?.user?.role;

return (
  <>
    {userRole === 'admin' && <button>Delete</button>}
    {['admin', 'editor'].includes(userRole) && <button>Edit</button>}
    <button>View</button>
  </>
);
Use role-based layouts or guards to hide entire sections from unauthorized users.

5. Audit and Logging
Log every allow/deny decision to track security events:

console.log(`[RBAC] ${role} attempted to access ${resource}: ${allowed ? 'ALLOWED' : 'DENIED'}`);
Store these logs (or display in the console) to demonstrate how access is evaluated.

Pro Tip: Logging permission checks helps with auditing, debugging, and future policy improvements.

6. Document in README
Your README.md should include:

A roles & permissions table

Example of policy evaluation logic (how checks are done)

Allow/Deny test results or logs as evidence

Reflection on:

How your design supports scalability and auditing
How you would adapt it for more complex systems (e.g., policy-based access)
Deliverables
Defined role hierarchy and permission mapping
Applied role checks in both API routes and UI components
Created logs or test cases showing allowed and denied actions
Updated README.md explaining roles, permissions, and reflections
Pro Tip: RBAC is the foundation of secure systems. It prevents privilege abuse, supports audit trails, and scales gracefully as your product grows.





## 📌 Overview

This assignment demonstrates how **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** is designed and enforced in a Next.js application to ensure users can only access actions and resources they are authorized for. RBAC improves security by assigning permissions to **roles** instead of individual users, making the system scalable, auditable, and easier to maintain.

The implementation covers **backend API protection**, **frontend UI control**, **logging for auditing**, and **clear documentation** of access policies.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

* Define a clear role hierarchy and permission mapping
* Secure API routes with role-based permission checks
* Conditionally render UI elements based on user roles
* Log allow/deny decisions for auditing and debugging
* Document RBAC design decisions and scalability considerations

---

## 🔐 Understanding RBAC

Role-Based Access Control assigns permissions based on a user's **role** rather than their individual identity.

### Why RBAC?

* Prevents unauthorized access
* Reduces privilege abuse
* Simplifies permission management
* Scales well as the application grows

Instead of checking *who* a user is, the system checks *what role* they have and *what that role is allowed to do*.

---

## 🧩 Roles & Permissions

### Role Hierarchy

| Role   | Permissions                  |
| ------ | ---------------------------- |
| Admin  | Create, Read, Update, Delete |
| Editor | Read, Update                 |
| Viewer | Read only                    |

### Role Configuration

Roles and permissions are centrally defined to ensure consistency across the application:

```js
// src/config/roles.js
export const roles = {
  admin: ['create', 'read', 'update', 'delete'],
  editor: ['read', 'update'],
  viewer: ['read'],
};
```

📌 **Design Choice:**

* Permissions are kept broad to avoid excessive complexity
* New roles or permissions can be added without modifying core logic

---

## 🔑 Authentication & Role Storage

After successful authentication, the user’s role is embedded in the JWT payload:

```js
const payload = { userId, role: 'editor' };
const token = jwt.sign(payload, process.env.JWT_SECRET, { expiresIn: '15m' });
```

This allows secure and stateless access control across API routes.

---

## 🛡️ RBAC Enforcement in API Routes

Sensitive API routes validate permissions before executing any action.

### Example: Delete Resource API

```js
import { roles } from '@/config/roles';

export default function handler(req, res) {
  const { role } = req.user;

  if (!roles[role].includes('delete')) {
    console.log(`[RBAC] ${role} attempted DELETE: DENIED`);
    return res.status(403).json({ error: 'Access denied: insufficient permissions.' });
  }

  console.log(`[RBAC] ${role} attempted DELETE: ALLOWED`);
  res.status(200).json({ message: 'Resource deleted successfully.' });
}
```

### Security Notes

* Permission checks are enforced **server-side**
* Frontend checks are never trusted alone
* JWT verification middleware attaches user data before route execution

---

## 🖥️ Role-Based Access in the UI

The frontend conditionally renders components based on user role and permissions.

```jsx
const userRole = session?.user?.role;

return (
  <>
    {userRole === 'admin' && <button>Delete</button>}
    {['admin', 'editor'].includes(userRole) && <button>Edit</button>}
    <button>View</button>
  </>
);
```

### Benefits

* Improves user experience by hiding unauthorized actions
* Reduces accidental access attempts
* Complements backend enforcement

---

## 🧪 Audit Logging & Monitoring

Every permission check logs whether access was **allowed or denied**:

```js
console.log(`[RBAC] ${role} attempted to access ${resource}: ${allowed ? 'ALLOWED' : 'DENIED'}`);
```

### Example Logs

```
[RBAC] viewer attempted DELETE: DENIED
[RBAC] editor attempted UPDATE: ALLOWED
[RBAC] admin attempted DELETE: ALLOWED
```

📌 **Why Logging Matters:**

* Enables auditing and security reviews
* Helps debug authorization issues
* Provides visibility into access patterns

---

## 🧠 Design Reflections

### Scalability

* Centralized role mapping makes it easy to add new roles
* API-level enforcement ensures consistency across clients
* JWT-based role storage supports distributed systems

### Auditing & Transparency

* Clear logs show how decisions are made
* Policies are explicit and easy to review
